> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch is synced automatically to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/coryginsberg/personal-website-2023) on every push and thus will always be what the live site runs. For that reason, please ensure any changes are merged upstream with the `dev/main` branch (which is synced with the test site) before they're landed in `main`
